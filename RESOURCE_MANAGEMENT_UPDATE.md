# Resource Management Update

## Summary
Added comprehensive resource management functionality to the admin panel with hide/show, edit, and delete capabilities. All changes are connected to Firebase Firestore database.

## Changes Made

### 1. Admin Dashboard - Main Resource Hub Page
**File**: `backend/admin-dashboard/src/app/resource-hub/page.tsx`

#### New Features:
- **Hide/Show Toggle**: Admin can toggle resource visibility between 'published' and 'draft' status
  - Published resources are visible to users on the frontend
  - Draft resources are hidden from users but visible in admin panel
  - Visual indicator with eye icon (eye-slash for hidden, eye for visible)

- **Edit Resource**: Admin can edit existing resources
  - Opens the same dialog used for adding resources
  - Pre-fills form with existing resource data
  - Updates resource in Firebase on save

- **Delete Resource**: Admin can delete resources with confirmation
  - Shows confirmation dialog before deletion
  - Removes resource from Firebase database

#### Implementation Details:
- Added `editingResource` state to track which resource is being edited
- Added `handleToggleResourceStatus()` to switch between published/draft
- Added `handleEditResource()` to open edit dialog with pre-filled data
- Updated `handleSaveResource()` to handle both create and update operations
- Updated resource list UI to show hide/show, edit, and delete buttons

### 2. Admin Dashboard - Category-Specific Page
**File**: `backend/admin-dashboard/src/app/resource-hub/[category]/page.tsx`

#### New Features:
- **Add Resource Dialog**: Full dialog implementation for adding resources to specific categories
- **Edit Resource**: Same edit functionality as main page
- **Hide/Show Toggle**: Same visibility toggle as main page
- **Delete Resource**: Same delete functionality as main page

#### Implementation Details:
- Added complete dialog component with form fields (title, description, external link)
- Added all CRUD operation handlers
- Connected "Add Resource" button to open dialog
- Added resource management buttons to each resource item

### 3. Frontend - Resources Page
**File**: `frontend/app/resources/page.tsx`

#### Updates:
- **Published Resources Only**: Frontend now only displays resources with 'published' status
- **Resource Count Display**: Shows accurate count of published resources per category
- **Empty State Handling**: Properly handles categories with no published resources

#### Implementation Details:
- Updated resource filtering to check `status === 'published'`
- Added resource count display on category cards
- Enhanced empty state handling for better UX

## Database Structure

### Resources Collection (`resources`)
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  category: string;
  fileUrl: string;
  status: 'published' | 'draft';  // Controls visibility
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  downloads: number;
}
```

### Resource Categories Collection (`resourceCategories`)
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  icon: string;
  iconColor: string;
  bgColor: string;
  order: number;
  isActive: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

## User Flow

### Admin Panel:
1. **View Resources**: Navigate to Resource Hub to see all categories and resources
2. **Add Resource**: Click "Add" button on category card or "Add Resource" on category page
3. **Edit Resource**: Click edit (blue) button on any resource
4. **Hide/Show Resource**: Click eye icon to toggle visibility (orange = hide, green = show)
5. **Delete Resource**: Click delete (red) button and confirm

### Frontend:
1. **View Categories**: Users see all active categories with published resource counts
2. **View Resources**: Users only see resources with 'published' status
3. **Access Resources**: Click on category to view available resources
4. **Empty State**: Categories with no published resources show "Coming soon" message

## Firebase Integration

All operations are connected to Firebase Firestore:
- **Create**: `resourceService.addResource()`
- **Read**: `resourceService.getPublishedResources()` (frontend), `resourceService.getAllResources()` (admin)
- **Update**: `resourceService.updateResource()`
- **Delete**: `resourceService.deleteResource()`

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Add new resource from main Resource Hub page
- [ ] Add new resource from category-specific page
- [ ] Edit existing resource
- [ ] Toggle resource visibility (published â†” draft)
- [ ] Delete resource with confirmation
- [ ] Verify published resources appear on frontend
- [ ] Verify draft resources are hidden from frontend
- [ ] Verify resource counts are accurate
- [ ] Test empty state handling

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple resources for bulk hide/delete
2. **File Upload**: Direct file upload instead of external links
3. **Resource Preview**: Preview resource before publishing
4. **Version History**: Track resource changes over time
5. **Search & Filter**: Advanced filtering in admin panel
6. **Analytics**: Track resource views and downloads
