# âœ… DEPLOYMENT FIX APPLIED

## The Issue Was:
The `deploy/firebase/public` directory didn't exist, causing the copy command to fail.

## What I Fixed:
Updated the deployment script to create the parent directory before copying files.

## Now Deploy With This Command:

```bash
cd /Users/shivang/Developer/namdapha-website
./deploy/scripts/deploy-firebase.sh hosting
```

## Or Test Locally First:

```bash
cd /Users/shivang/Developer/namdapha-website/deploy/firebase/public/frontend
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit: http://localhost:8000

## Your Files Are Ready:
âœ… Frontend built successfully
âœ… Files copied to `deploy/firebase/public/frontend/`
âœ… Deployment script fixed

## Deploy Now! ðŸš€
